          <h1>So you want a little backstory?</h1>

          <p>
            My name's Graham Bewley. I'm a web developer from Michigan. I have a
            bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Saginaw Valley State
            University, where along with learning a lot of math and C++, I
            discovered a passion for working on the web.
          </p>

          <p>
            Since graduating from college, I've added a few more skills to my
            toolset, learning <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Node</strong>,
            and building some <a href="/projects">hobby projects</a> along the
            way. I've worked with a number of frameworks &mdash; like
            <strong>Gatsby</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong> &mdash; along
            with useful web technologies &mdash; like
            <strong>WebSockets</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong> &mdash; to
            create functional and beautiful websites and apps.
          </p>

          <p>
            While my focus is on all things JavaScript, I'm also familiar with
            advanced styling patterns using modern <strong>CSS</strong>, and the
            value of semantic and accessible <strong>HTML</strong>.
          </p>

          <h1>And when I'm away from my desk?</h1>

          <p>
            I love spending time with my wife, Jordan, and our two dogs, Chayse
            and Brooklyn. We try to get outside for some camping and hiking
            whenever we get the chance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Otherwise, I spend much of my free time mountain biking, but also
            enjoy road biking, gravel riding &mdash; anything with two wheels
            and pedals. When we're stuck indoors, I do a bit of home brewing,
            and make a mean pale ale.
